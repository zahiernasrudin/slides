## Welcome

::: incremental
-   This is a flexible workshop!
-   Feel free to raise your hand if you have any questions, at any time
-   There will be a dedicated **10-minute Q&A session** at the end.
:::

## What is documentation

::: incremental
-   Providing **clear** and **comprehensive information, guidelines, prerequisites, and descriptions** related to a process, project, or dataset.

    -   Serves as a **reference** for understanding the data, methods, and workflows used.

-   Ensures **consistency, reproducibility,** and **effective collaboration** across teams.
:::

## Importance of Documentation

::: incremental
-   **Understanding**: Documentation provides a clear understanding of the processes, what the data is about, the source, and also the structure

-   **Consistency:** Documentation provides clear guidelines that organize structure, ensuring consistent outcomes.

-   **Collaboration:** Documentation helps communication among stakeholders/team members and aids in understanding and building upon existing work

::: incremental

-   Introduction

    -   *Brief overview of the documentation*. For example, this documentation provides the guidelines, processes, and challenges during the prediction of house prices using Linear Regression.

-   Goals

    -   *List the goals of the documentation aims to achieve.*

-   Scope

    -   *Define the scope of the documentation. Presenting it in list format could also be effective*

-   Rules/Prerequisites

    -   *List any necessary conditions, rules, requirements, or pre-conditions that must be met before proceeding with the subsequent steps outlined in the documentation.*
        -   For example, users must have R installed to perform the prediction of house prices.

-   Roles/Responsibilities

    -   *To outline the roles and responsibilities assigned to team members involved in the project.*
        -   While it is not mandatory, listing assignments for each team member aims to ensure effective collaboration and clarify individual contributions to the project.

    -   *Step-by-step processes/instructions for each task*

-   Challenges

    -   *Common issues/challenges faced and their solutions*
        -   Provide insights on problems encountered during the project and how they were resolved.

-   References

    -   *List any references, files, or sources utilized during this project.*

-   Data Dictionary
    -   Focusing on the column names, definitions/descriptions & attributes
    -   **Definition of each variable**:
        -   **Column Name**: The name of the column

        -   **Column Type**: The type of data stored.

        -   **Description**: What the variable represents.

        -   **Values:** Values inside the data (e.g., ranges or categories of data stored in the column)

## Template or Example (Continue) {.smaller}



-   Data Dictionary

```{r}


library(readxl)
library(reactable)

data_dict <- read_excel("template/data_dictionary.xlsx")

reactable(data_dict, filterable = T, striped = T
          
          )
```



## Best Practices

-   Clear, simple and concise

    -   Aim for clarity in writing to enhance understanding.

-   Use Consistent Formats:

    -   Maintain uniform templates for documentation.

    -   Ensure standardized naming conventions and definitions.

-   Regularly update documentation

    -   Incorporate feedback from users to improve content and usability.
